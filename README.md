## Improvement(s) - Question 10

## Problem Domain
In the quest for seamless and effective organisational processes in a college, the technology 
department of the college has been given the task to digitize and automate its academic-facing 
processes.

The technology department has decided to use Domain Driven Design to actualize this. A section of 
the technology team was given the responsibility to solicit requirements based on the as-is processes. 
Thus, after many analysis meetings, they have come up with a domain model.
